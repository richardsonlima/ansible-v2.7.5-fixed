bugfixes:
- vars_prompt with encrypt does not require passlib for the algorithms
  supported by crypt.
- Additional checks ensure that there is always a result of hashing passwords
  in the password_hash filter and vars_prompt, otherwise an error is returned.
  Some modules (like user module) interprets None as no password at all,
  which can be dangerous if the password given above is passed directly into
  those modules.
- Avoids deprecated functionality of passlib with newer library versions.
- password_hash does not hard-code the salt-length, which fixes bcrypt
  in connection with passlib as bcrypt requires a salt with length 22.
minor_changes:
- The password_hash filter supports all parameters of passlib.
  This allows users to provide a rounds parameter.
