minor_changes:
- The apt, ec2_elb_lb, elb_classic_lb, and unarchive modules have been ported
  away from using __file__.  This is futureproofing as__file__ won't work if we
  switch to using python -m to invoke modules in the future or if we figure out
  a way to make a module never touch disk for pipelining purposes.
