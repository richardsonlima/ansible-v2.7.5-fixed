minor_changes:
- In Ansible-2.4 and above, Ansible passes the temporary directory a module
  should use to the module.  This is done via a module parameter
  (_ansible_tmpdir).  An earlier version of this which was also prototyped in
  Ansible-2.4 development used an environment variable, ANSIBLE_REMOTE_TMP to
  pass this information to the module instead.  When we switched to using
  a module parameter, the environment variable was left in by mistake.
  Ansible-2.7 removes that variable.  Any third party modules which relied on
  it should use the module parameter instead.
