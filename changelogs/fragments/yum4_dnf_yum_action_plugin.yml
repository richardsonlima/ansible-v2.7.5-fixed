major_changes:
  - yum and dnf modules now at feature parity
  - new yum action plugin enables the yum module to work with both yum3
    and dnf-based yum4 by detecting the backend package manager and routing
    commands through the correct Ansible module for that python API
  - New yumdnf module defines the shared argument specification for both
    yum and dnf modules and provides an entry point to share code when
    applicable

minor_changes:
  - Fixed group actions in check mode to report correct changed state
  - Better error handling for depsolve and transaction errors in DNF
  - Fixed group action idempotent transactions in dnf backend
  - Add use_backend to yum module/action plugin
  - Fix dnf handling of autoremove to be compatible with yum
  - Enable installroot tests for yum4(dnf) integration testing, dnf
    backend now supports that
  - Switch from zip to bc for certain package install/remove test
    cases in yum integration tests. The dnf depsolver downgrades
    python when you uninstall zip which alters the test environment
    and we have no control over that.
