removed_features:
- The configuration toggle, ``merge_multiple_cli_tags``, has been removed.
  This setting controlled whether specifying ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags``
  multiple times on the commandline would merge the specified tags or use the
  old behaviour of overwriting the previous entry.  The overwriting behaviour
  was deprecated in 2.3 and the default value of the config option became merge
  in 2.4.
